# Simple State Store
Also known as S<sup>5</sup> (Simple and Still Stupid State Store).

## Use Case
A class must receive events produced in a much more frequent rate it can handles. For example: a backend is receiving events from underlying subsystems, but the front-end is not able to process all those events.
